<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Dialysis Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial dialysis device market comprises two main types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves using a machine to filter blood through an artificial kidney, removing waste and excess fluid. This process typically occurs in a clinical setting. In contrast, peritoneal dialysis utilizes the lining of the abdomen as a natural filter, allowing patients to perform dialysis at home using a sterile solution infused into the abdominal cavity. Both methods provide essential renal support for patients with kidney failure.</p></p>
