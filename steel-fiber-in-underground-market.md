<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Fiber in Underground Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold-drawn Steel Wire Fibers</li><li>Cold-drawn Shaved Steel Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the underground market, steel fibers are crucial for enhancing the strength and durability of materials, particularly in construction and mining applications. Cold-drawn steel wire fibers are produced by drawing wire through dies, resulting in high tensile strength and flexibility, ideal for reinforced concrete. Cold-drawn shaved steel fibers, on the other hand, are crafted by shaving flat sheets into thin strips, offering improved bonding properties and distribution within concrete. Both types enhance structural integrity and resistance to cracking under stress.</p></p>
