<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Data Center Liquid Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Cooling</li><li>Two Phase Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The data center liquid cooling market is categorized into two main types: single-phase cooling and two-phase cooling. Single-phase cooling involves the circulation of a liquid, typically water, to absorb heat from equipment, which is then cooled in a heat exchanger. Two-phase cooling, on the other hand, utilizes a refrigerant that evaporates and condenses, allowing for more efficient heat transfer and reducing the cooling infrastructure size. Both methods enhance energy efficiency and manage high thermal loads in data centers effectively.</p></p>
