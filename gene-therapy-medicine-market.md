<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy Medicine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oral</li><li>Injection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy medicine encompasses various methods of delivering genetic material to treat diseases, primarily categorized into oral and injection routes. Oral gene therapy utilizes specially formulated nanoparticles or liposomes to protect the genetic material as it travels through the digestive system, offering a non-invasive delivery option. In contrast, injection-based gene therapy involves administering genes directly into the target tissue or bloodstream, ensuring immediate accessibility to cells. Both methods aim to modify or replace defective genes, enhancing therapeutic outcomes.</p></p>
