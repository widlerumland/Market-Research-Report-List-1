<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fire-tube</li><li>Water-tube</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The boiler market primarily features two types: fire-tube and water-tube boilers. Fire-tube boilers consist of a series of tubes through which hot gases pass, transferring heat to the water surrounding them, making them ideal for lower pressure applications. In contrast, water-tube boilers circulate water through tubes heated by external combustion gases, allowing for higher pressure and steam generation, suitable for industrial applications. Each type serves distinct market needs based on efficiency, pressure requirements, and application suitability.</p></p>
