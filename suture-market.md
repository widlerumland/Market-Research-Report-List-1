<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Sutures</li><li>Non-absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The suture market is divided into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable sutures. Absorbable sutures are designed to naturally degrade over time, eliminating the need for removal and are typically used in internal tissues or areas where healing occurs rapidly. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, are made from materials that do not break down in the body and are often used in applications requiring long-term support, such as in skin closure or for certain types of surgeries.</p></p>
