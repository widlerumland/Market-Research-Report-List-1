<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inductive Loop Vehicle Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Saw Cut Loop</li><li>Performed Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inductive Loop Vehicle Detectors are crucial for traffic management, with two primary market types: saw cut loops and preformed loops. Saw cut loops involve cutting grooves into the pavement where wires are embedded, providing accurate detection. They are often used in new installations. Preformed loops, on the other hand, consist of flexible wire loops that can be laid on the surface before the asphalt is applied. This method is faster and less invasive, making it suitable for retrofitting existing roadways.</p></p>
